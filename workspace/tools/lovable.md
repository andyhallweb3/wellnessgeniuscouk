# Lovable - What It Is and How We Use It

## What is Lovable
Lovable (lovable.dev) is an AI-powered app builder that generates
full-stack web applications from natural language prompts. It builds
React frontends with Supabase backends, deploys instantly, and allows
iterative editing through conversation.

## How Andy Uses It
Andy uses Lovable as the rapid prototyping and build layer for
Wellness Genius and client projects. It significantly compresses
the time from idea to working product - what would take a
developer days to scaffold can be live in hours.

Current and past Wellness Genius builds using Lovable:
- AI readiness assessment tools
- Operator diagnostic dashboards
- Client-facing reporting interfaces
- Internal pipeline and ticket trackers

## Why It Matters for the Consulting Offer
Lovable is a core reason the 60-day build promise is credible.
It handles frontend scaffolding and UI rapidly, freeing the
Vietnam dev team to focus on backend logic, integrations,
AI agent architecture, and data pipelines.

For clients this means:
- Faster time to working prototype (often within week one)
- Lower build cost on UI-heavy projects
- Iterative design in real time during discovery
- Client can see and interact with something real early

## What Lovable Is Good For
- Member-facing portals and dashboards
- Operator admin interfaces
- Assessment and diagnostic tools
- Booking and scheduling frontends
- Reporting and insight dashboards
- Internal tools for wellness operators
- MVP builds for wellness startups
- Rapid prototyping for consulting proposals

## What Lovable Is NOT Good For
- Complex backend AI agent logic (use Python/Node for this)
- Deep API integrations (handled by dev team)
- Production-grade security-sensitive systems without review
- Replacing the dev team - it accelerates them, not replaces them

## How to Use Lovable Effectively
Always connect Supabase before starting a build for
persistent data storage. Start with a clear single-page prompt
describing the end user, the core action, and the data needed.
Iterate conversationally - treat it like briefing a developer.
Export clean code to GitHub for the dev team to extend.

## Lovable + Wellness Genius Platform
The Wellness Genius assessment tools and diagnostic interfaces
are strong candidates for Lovable builds. New operator-facing
features can be prototyped in Lovable, validated with real users,
then hardened by the dev team for production.

## Recommending Lovable to Clients
Recommend Lovable when:
- Client needs to see something working fast to get internal
  buy-in
- Budget is limited but the idea is solid
- The core value is in the data/AI layer not the UI
- Client has a small tech team who can maintain a clean
  React/Supabase codebase

Do NOT recommend when:
- Client has zero technical resource for ongoing maintenance
- Project requires complex compliance or data sovereignty
- Legacy system integrations are the primary challenge

## Pricing Context
Lovable is subscription-based with a free tier for prototyping.
For client projects Andy typically builds in Lovable on his
account during discovery, then hands off clean code or
migrates to client infrastructure at deployment.
